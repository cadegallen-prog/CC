# Project Quick Start

## What This Project Does
Identifies what each of 425 Home Depot products actually IS (their product type), so they can later be mapped to categories.

## For You
- **Your role:** Decide what to analyze and how to use results
- **Your data:** 425 products in `data/scraped_data_output.json`

## For AI Assistants
- **AI role:** Do ALL technical work (code, decisions, execution, fixes)
- **Communication:** Plain English only, no jargon, show results
- **Key files:** `.clinerules` (rules), `WORKFLOW_EXPLANATION.md` (project details)

## Two-Stage Workflow
1. **NOW:** Identify product types (ceiling fan, LED bulb, etc.)
2. **LATER:** Map to Facebook's 373 taxonomy (on backburner)

## Reference Docs
- `WORKFLOW_EXPLANATION.md` - Detailed project workflow
- `.clinerules` - AI assistant rules (ultra-concise)
- `AI_ASSISTANT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - AI rules (detailed)
- `docs/` - Setup guides (Git, VSCode, etc.)
